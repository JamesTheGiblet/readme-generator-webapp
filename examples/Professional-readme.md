## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/readme-generator-webapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd readme-generator-webapp
   ```

3. Start a local web server:

   This application uses `fetch` to load templates and must be run from a server. You cannot open `index.html` directly as a file.

   ```bash
   # For Python 3
   python -m http.server
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

### Usage

This tool offers two primary workflows:

1. **GitHub Generator:** Provide a public GitHub repository URL to automatically analyze and pre-fill project details.
2. **Manual Generator:** Follow the guided, multi-step form to build your README from scratch.
