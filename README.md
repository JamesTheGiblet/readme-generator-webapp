## About The Project

![Project Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345/123456789-abcdef.png)
*A placeholder for a screenshot of your awesome app!*

This tool was born from the need to simplify one of the most crucial yet often tedious parts of software development: writing good documentation. It provides a guided, interactive experience to help developers produce clean, comprehensive, and professional README files for their projects.

Built on the principles of **privacy** and **empowerment**, this application runs entirely on the client-side. No project data you enter is ever sent to a server, ensuring your work remains confidential.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üìù Guided Multi-Step Form:** An intuitive, step-by-step process that walks you through every necessary section of a high-quality README.
* **üëÅÔ∏è Live Interactive Preview:** See the fully rendered Markdown output update in real-time as you fill out the forms.
* **üîó GitHub Repo Analysis:** Optionally provide a GitHub URL to automatically analyze your repository and pre-fill project details.
* **üé® Tones & Customization:** Choose from multiple README tones (Professional, Friendly, etc.) to match your project's style.
* **üì• Easy Export:** Instantly copy the generated Markdown to your clipboard or download it as a `README.md` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a focus on client-side performance and has no server-side dependencies, embracing Privacy by Design.
